! Stop! so, keys cant belong two two different mod groups at once?
! And bspwm group 'super' seems to pull from the default group for Super/Hper: mod4
! So I can't clear that and set left/right keys differently, otherwise base 'super'
! doesn't work in bspwm? figure out a compromise to this ...
!clear mod1
!clear mod2
!clear mod3
!clear mod4
!
!keycode 133 = Super_L
!keycode 134 = Super_R
!keycode 207 = Hyper_L
!keycode 208 = Hyper_R
!
!add mod3 = Super_L Hyper_L
!add mod4 = Super_R Hyper_R
