# Hacker scripts

This is a super simple, totally BS suite of bash scripts I put together that, when run, all look like something out of a bad sci-fi movie interface (includes colors!).

Constantly a bit of a work in progress, inspired by geektyper.com and hackertyper.com.

Might later make these into an ubersicht or conky widget?
