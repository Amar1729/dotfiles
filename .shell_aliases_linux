# Shell aliases - linux-specific

# note - this is kind of a temporary state. these aliases are pretty disorganized right now.

# linux locking
# make sure you have a lock script haha
#alias lock="~/.config/scripts/lock.sh -l 2>/dev/null"
#alias lock="~/Downloads/wm/i3-pixel-lock/lock 1"
# the lock script is betterlockscreen in ~/.config/scripts
# it is symlinked into /opt/bin as "lock"

# temporary:
alias batt="upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep percentage | grep -o '[0-9]\+%'"

# copy/paste
alias pbcopy="xsel -ib"
alias pbpaste="xsel -ob"


# put this here for now:
# so, ubuntu has nice understanding of mac function keys and special ops:
