# my theme:
#	style similar to powerlevel9k 
#	doesn't include virtualenvs in the first slice
#	DOES truncate dirpath to last 2 (or 25 chars)
#	- no battery status (i don't need this)
#	simpler vcs
#	TODO:
#		vcs: sha hash, working dir status, upstream status, commits ahead, etc ...
#	note - I liked pure theme. possible to create fork/temp for 'pure' work?
